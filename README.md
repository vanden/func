# Func

*Func* is a little JavaScript Swiss-Army knife providing expected, missing, and less-cumbersome helper functions.

## Details

*Func* doesn't use globals, it doesn't modify existing objects, and it doesn't come with the overhead of similar existing toolsets. It gives you just under 30 utility functions including iterators, functors, comparators, and higher-order functions.

*Func* was written in ES6+ for native module support. There is an ES5 version if you're a proud dinosaur.
